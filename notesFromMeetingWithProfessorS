notes for Catan


Summary 
Naming consistency issues
Git
CAN's just need to be accessible
Server facade - be careful with how big it can get
Command pattern issues - just for diagram


we have chance to gain back half the points we do not meet

make changes, give TA notes, changes we made, and UML

----------------------

Server Poller - if updates come only through here, there will be a wait. Haven't talked about dependency injection - how do we tell which proxy to use
	Dependency Injection - Set proxy 

Proxy model - he can live with that...
	Server side commands will not have the same similarity. There wil be multiple 
	Handlers in UML are classes in javadocs

	
Map - make an easier way to access CAN actions - don't make them so far down a path
    - make a facade that has access to map, game, etc... Then controllers will have easier access to CAN's through this facade 
	
User - valid is what was referred to as Validation by the TA's

Serialization - should work for current setup - will have to work with other direction for info flow
